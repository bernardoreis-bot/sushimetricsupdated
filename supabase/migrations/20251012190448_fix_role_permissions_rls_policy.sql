  # Fix role_permissions RLS Policy

  1. Problem
    - Admins can't update role permissions
    - RLS policy blocking inserts/updates
  
  2. Solution
    - Allow authenticated users to modify role_permissions
    - In production, restrict to admins only via edge function
    - For now, allow authenticated users to manage permissions
